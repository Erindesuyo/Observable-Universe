            Exoplanets are planets orbiting stars outside our solar system.<br> 
            They vary in size and conditions, with some potentially habitable. <br>
            Scientists study them to understand the universe and 
            search for life beyond Earth.

            <p>Discovery Date: 2016</p>            
            <p>Proxima Centauri b is the closest known exoplanet to Earth,
                 orbiting within the habitable zone of the red dwarf star
                  Proxima Centauri, which is part of the Alpha Centauri 
                  star system. While it is within the temperature range 
                  for liquid water to exist, its habitability is still 
                  debated due to potential high radiation exposure from 
                  its parent star. It is tidally locked, meaning one side
                  always faces the star while the other remains in darkness, 
                  creating extreme temperature differences.</p>

            <p>Size: 1.27 x Jupiter</p>
            <p>Discovery Date: 2017</p>
            <p>Kepler-452b is often called 'Earth 2.0' or 'Earth’s cousin' 
                because of its similarity in size and its orbit around a Sun-like star. 
                It is about 60% larger than Earth and takes 385 days to complete one orbit,
                 making its year slightly longer than Earth's. However, 
                 its surface conditions remain unknown. Scientists speculate 
                 it may have active volcanoes and a rocky terrain, but because 
                 it is 1,400 light-years away, direct observation remains difficult.</p>

            <p>Discovery Date: 2006</p>
            <p>TrES-2b, discovered in 2006, holds the title of the darkest known exoplanet.
                 It reflects less than 1% of incoming light, making it darker than coal.
                  It orbits a Sun-like star 750 light-years away and is classified as a hot 
                  Jupiter, meaning it is a gas giant with an extremely close orbit around 
                  its star. Despite its darkness, it glows faintly red due to the extreme 
                  temperatures exceeding 1,800°C. </p>

            <p>Discovery Date: 2004</p>
            <p>55 Cancri e, discovered in 2004, is known as the 'Diamond Planet'
                 because of its high carbon content, which could allow diamonds 
                 to form under extreme pressure. It is a super-Earth, about twice 
                 the size of Earth, and orbits its star so closely that a year 
                 lasts only 18 hours. The planet has a scorching surface temperature of 
                 around 2,400°C, and due to its proximity to its star, it may have a 
                 lava-covered surface. </p>

            <p>Size: 1.13 x Jupiter</p>
            <p>Discovery Date: 2005</p>
            <p>HD 189773b, discovered in 2005, is famous for its terrifying weather.
                It experiences winds of over 8,700 km/h and rains molten glass due to
                its extreme temperatures. The deep blue color of the planet is caused 
                by silicate particles in its atmosphere that scatter blue light.
                It is a hot Jupiter, meaning it is a gas giant that orbits very close
                to its star. The intense radiation from its star causes the atmosphere
                to evaporate, forming a comet-like tail behind the planet.</p>

            <p>Kepler-452b, discovered in 2015, is often called 'Earth 2.0' because of its
                similarities to Earth. It is about 60% larger than Earth and orbits within
                the habitable zone of a Sun-like star. It takes 385 days to complete an orbit,
                making its year slightly longer than Earth's. Scientists believe it could have
                a rocky surface and possibly an atmosphere, but because it is 1,400 
                light-years away, direct observation is difficult. Some models suggest that 
                if it has water, it could be in a stage of runaway greenhouse effect, similar to Venus.</p>
